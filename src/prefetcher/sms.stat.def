/* These ".stat" files contain the various statistics that can be taken via
  STAT_EVENTs. It's not a good idea to reorder these, since many calls are made
  like STAT_EVENT(ICACHE_MISS + hit) which could update either.  All stats are
  printed both as 'Interval' and 'Cumulative'.  'Interval' is measured during
  the current stat interval, 'Cumulative' is over the entire run so far.

   DEF_STAT( Name, Type, Ratio )

   The 'Type' column is used to group statistics together and format the
  printouts somewhat.  See the 'RATIO' type for a description of the 'Ratio
  Stat' column. Possible 'Type' values are:

  COUNT -- The count is what's important.  Just print the number of times it
  occurred.

  PER_CYCLE -- We care about how many times this occured per cycle, so divide by
  the number of cycles.  (Ex. IPC)  The count is also printed.

  PER_INST -- Same thing, but per instruction.

  DIST -- This is a little bit complicated.  The first DIST type encountered
  signals the beginning of a distribution.  The next DIST encountered marks the
  end of the distribution (inclusive).  All of the stats in-between should be of
  type COUNT.  All of the stats in a distribution are printed as a percentage of
  the total.

  RATIO -- This stat should be printed as a ratio.  The 'Ratio' argument
  determines which other stat should be used.  The current stat is divided by
  that specified in the 'Ratio Stat' column.  This column is ignored for all
  types but RATIO.
